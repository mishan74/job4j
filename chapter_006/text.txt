Remember who you are. Everyone has one's own path. Now or never. Always forgive your enemies - nothing annoys them so much. Life is beautiful. Illusion is the first of all pleasures. A man is always afraid of the unknown, because what is known is less scary. Enjoy every moment. The only thing in life achieved without effort is failure.
